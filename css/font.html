    <p>MS Dhoni, one of the most iconic Indian cricketers of all time and the cricketer who made India fall in love with Twenty20 cricket, has confirmed his retirement from the international game at the age of 39.
                
        Dhoni captained India to victory in the inaugural T20 World Cup - then called the World T20 - in 2007, and to the one-day international World Cup on home soil in 2011, which Dhoni famously sealed with a six, finishing on 91 not out. He also led India to the 2013 Champions Trophy. 
        
        In a remarkable international career that spanned 15 years, from 2004 to the 2019 World Cup semi-final, Dhoni scored 17,266 international runs. While he scored six hundreds in his 90 Tests at an average of 38, leading India to world number one from 2009-11, it is as a limited-overs cricketer that Dhoni will be best remembered.
        
        For vast swathes of his career, Dhoni seemed to have a preternatural ability to judge run chases, taking chases deep - almost theatrically so - and trusting himself to finish the job, just as he did that night at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011</p>
